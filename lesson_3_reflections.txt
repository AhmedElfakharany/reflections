When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
To let other people or team members push and pull the repositiory and work on the project together

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date 
with your remote repository?
To pull certain branch commits not every commit made in the repository
